# Angular Test Task

## Task

1. Create the new Angular 7 project using angular CLI
2. Create a page with a paginated users list. You should create custom components for the list itself and the particular user card. The user list should be horizontally centered. 
3. Use the following HTTP endpoint: https://reqres.in/api/users?page={page} to get the cards data, which includes avatar image, first_name, last_name and id for the card. Single user can be requested via this endpoint: https://reqres.in/api/users/{id}.
4. On click of the card, it should direct to a new page with information about this card.
5. On each individual card page a back button should be present.

## Important notes
1. Use angular router for navigation between two pages. 
2. Use random colors, fonts - as per your choice.
3. SCSS for any styling

## Optional
Introduce caching to avoid additional requests.
